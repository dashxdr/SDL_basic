Current version 103.

Had to tweak the grammar.y file for recent versions of bison to get it to
build.

Tweaked Makefile for newer LDARGS parameter.

** is the exponent (power) operator. ~ is unary binary NOT operator.

Current version 102.

Fixed problem with scrollback, wouldn't snap back down if you hit up arrow or
   down with no more lines in the history buffer...
Added "round <expr>" and placeholder "rotate <expr>" to box and rect
   commands, for doing rounded boxes and rectangles.
In grammar.y, added emitfuncint() function that takes a function plus an
   integer, and emits one followed by the other -- this is a very common
   operation. Fixed so everything that could now uses the new function.
Added arc and wedge commands.
Added shape interface. shinit, shend, shdone, shline, shcurve, shcubic.
Added cool14.bas demo -- inspired by inkscape's polygon tool.

Current version 101.

Fixed problem with dissassembling "pushi" instruction.
Fixed problem with vmachine's arrayd function, was using sizeof(double *)
   instead of sizeof(double). On my machine pointers and doubles are 8 bytes...
Added Makefile.osx for building on MAC OSX.
Added lock(), unlock() calls around in code to lock the SDL_surface. This
   fixes flickering on OSX, and is actually what you're supposed to do in SDL.
