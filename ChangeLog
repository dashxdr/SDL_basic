Current version 101.

Fixed problem with dissassembling "pushi" instruction.
Fixed problem with vmachine's arrayd function, was using sizeof(double *)
   instead of sizeof(double). On my machine pointers and doubles are 8 bytes...
Added Makefile.osx for building on MAC OSX.
Added lock(), unlock() calls around in code to lock the SDL_surface. This
   fixes flickering on OSX, and is actually what you're supposed to do in SDL.
